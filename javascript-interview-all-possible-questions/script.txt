What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript
There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

Object constructor:

The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

var object = new Object();
Object's create method:

The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

var object = Object.create(null);
Object literal syntax:

The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

var object = {
     name: "Sudheer"
     age: 34
};

Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
Note: This is an easiest way to create an object

Function constructor:

Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

function Person(name){
   this.name=name;
   this.age=21;
}
var object = new Person("Sudheer");
Function constructor with prototype:

This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

function Person(){}
Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
var object = new Person();
This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

function func {};

new func(x, y, z);
(OR)

// Create a new instance using function prototype.
var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

// Call the function
var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

// If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
ES6 Class syntax:

ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

class Person {
   constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
   }
}

var object = new Person("Sudheer");
Singleton pattern:

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

var object = new function(){
   this.name = "Sudheer";
}

What is a prototype chain
Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or proto property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype.

What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind
The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one

var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.call(employee1, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().

What is JSON and its common operations
JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

Parsing: Converting a string to a native object

JSON.parse(text)
Stringification: converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

JSON.stringify(object)

What is the purpose of the array slice method
The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

Some of the examples of this method are,

let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0,2); // returns [1,2]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2,3); // returns [3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
Note: Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of the array splice method
The splice() method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

Some of the examples of this method are,

let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0,2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
Note: Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

What is the difference between slice and splice
Some of the major difference in a tabular form

Slice	Splice
Doesn't modify the original array(immutable)	Modifies the original array(mutable)
Returns the subset of original array	Returns the deleted elements as array
Used to pick the elements from array	Used to insert or delete elements to/from array

How do you compare Object and Map
Objects are similar to Maps in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

What is the difference between == and === operators
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true
Some of the example which covers the above cases,

0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory

What are lambda or arrow functions
An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

What is a first class function
In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

const handler = () => console.log ('This is a click handler function');
document.addEventListener ('click', handler);

What is a first order function
First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.

const firstOrder = () => console.log ('I am a first order function!');

What is a higher order function
Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

const firstOrderFunc = () => console.log ('Hello, I am a First order function');
const higherOrder = ReturnFirstOrderFunc => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);

What is a unary function
Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.

Let us take an example of unary function,

const unaryFunction = a => console.log (a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
⬆ Back to Top

What is the currying function
Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1,2,3));// 6

const curryUnaryFunction = a => b => c => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction (1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction (1) (2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction (1) (2) (3); // returns the number 6
Curried functions are great to improve code reusability and functional composition.

What is a pure function
A Pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

//Impure
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = number => numberArray.push(number);
//Pure
const pureAddNumber = number => argNumberArray =>
  argNumberArray.concat([number]);

//Display the results
console.log (impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
console.log (pureAddNumber(7) (numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
As per above code snippets, Push function is impure itself by altering the array and returning an push number index which is independent of parameter value. Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with Immutability concept of ES6 by giving preference to const over let usage.

What is the purpose of the let keyword
The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

let counter = 30;
if (counter === 30) {
  let counter = 31;
  console.log(counter); // 31
}
console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
⬆ Back to Top

What is the difference between let and var
You can list out the differences in a tabular format

var	let
It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript	Introduced as part of ES6
It has function scope	It has block scope
Variables will be hoisted	Hoisted but not initialized
Let's take an example to see the difference,

function userDetails(username) {
   if(username) {
     console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
     console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
     let age = 30;
     var salary = 10000;
   }
   console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
   console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails('John');

What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword
let is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible.

How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error
If you try to redeclare variables in a switch block then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

let counter = 1;
switch(x) {
  case 0:
    let name;
    break;

  case 1:
    let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}
To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

let counter = 1;
    switch(x) {
      case 0: {
        let name;
        break;
      }
      case 1: {
        let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
      }
    }

What is the Temporal Dead Zone
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

Let's see this behavior with an example,

function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}

What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

(function ()
    {
      // logic here
    }
 )
();
The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

(function ()
        {
          var message = "IIFE";
          console.log(message);
        }
 )
();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined

How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?
encodeURI() function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string. decodeURI() function is used to deocde an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.

Note: If you want to encode characters such as / ? : @ & = + $ # then you need to use encodeURIComponent().

let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);

What is memoization
Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache. Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

const memoizAddition = () => {
  let cache = {};
 return (value) => {
  if (value in cache) {
   console.log('Fetching from cache');
   return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
  }
  else {
   console.log('Calculating result');
   let result = value + 20;
   cache[value] = result;
   return result;
  }
 }
}
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached

What is Hoisting
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = 'The variable Has been hoisted';
The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

var message;
console.log(message);
message = 'The variable Has been hoisted';

What are classes in ES6
In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance. For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

function Bike(model,color) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function() {
    return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
};
Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

class Bike{
  constructor(color, model) {
    this.color= color;
    this.model= model;
  }

  getDetails() {
    return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
  }
}

What are closures
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
Outer function’s variables
Global variables
Let's take an example of closure concept,

function Welcome(name){
  var greetingInfo = function(message){
   console.log(message+' '+name);
  }
return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome('John');
myFunction('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction('Hello Mr.'); //output: Hello Mr.John
As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

What is scope in javascript
Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

What is a service worker
A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker
Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the postMessage interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

How do you reuse information across service worker restarts
The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's onfetch and onmessage handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

What is web storage
Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

Local storage: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
Session storage: It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

What is a post message
Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

What is a Cookie
A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs. For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

document.cookie = "username=John";
Screenshot

⬆ Back to Top

Why do you need a Cookie
Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.
⬆ Back to Top

What are the options in a cookie
There are few below options available for a cookie,

By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.
document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
⬆ Back to Top

How do you delete a cookie
You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case. For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

document.cookie = "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
Note: You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage
LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

How do you access web storage
The Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects which has localStorage(window.localStorage) and sessionStorage(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local). For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

localStorage.setItem('logo', document.getElementById('logo').value);
localStorage.getItem('logo');
⬆ Back to Top

What are the methods available on session storage
The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem('key');

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem('key');

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();

What is a storage event and its event handler
The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events. The syntax would be as below

 window.onstorage = functionRef;
Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

window.onstorage = function(e) {
  console.log('The ' + e.key +
    ' key has been changed from ' + e.oldValue +
    ' to ' + e.newValue + '.');
};

Why do you need web storage
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

How do you check web storage browser support
You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,

if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
}

How do you check web workers browser support
You need to check browser support for web workers before using it

if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
  // code for Web worker support.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
}
⬆ Back to Top

Give an example of a web worker
You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example

Create a Web Worker File: You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js
let i = 0;

function timedCount() {
  i = i + 1;
  postMessage(i);
  setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
}

timedCount();
Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page

Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js
if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {
  w = new Worker("counter.js");
}
and we can receive messages from web worker

w.onmessage = function(event){
  document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
};
Terminate a Web Worker: Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.
w.terminate();
Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code
w = undefined;

What is a promise
A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

    const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // promise description
    })
The usage of a promise would be as below,

const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("I'm a Promise!");
  }, 5000);

Why do you need a promise
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

⬆ Back to Top

What are the three states of promise
Promises have three states:

Pending: This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
Fulfilled: This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
Rejected: This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

What is a callback function
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log('Hello ' + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
⬆ Back to Top

Why do we need callbacks
The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events. Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

function firstFunction(){
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log('First function called');
  }, 1000 );
}
function secondFunction(){
  console.log('Second function called');
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output
// Second function called
// First function called
As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

What is a callback hell
Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});

What are server-sent events
Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This has been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

⬆ Back to Top

How do you receive server-sent event notifications
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,

if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
  source.onmessage = function(event) {
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
  };
}
⬆ Back to Top

How do you check browser support for server-sent events
You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,

if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
} else {
  // No server-sent events supported
}
⬆ Back to Top

What are the events available for server sent events
Below are the list of events available for server sent events

Event	Description
onopen	It is used when a connection to the server is opened
onmessage	This event is used when a message is received
onerror	It happens when an error occurs

What are the main rules of promise
A promise must follow a specific set of rules,

A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant .then() method
A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.
⬆ Back to Top

What is callback in callback
You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

loadScript('/script1.js', function(script) {
   console.log('first script is loaded');

  loadScript('/script2.js', function(script) {

    console.log('second script is loaded');

    loadScript('/script3.js', function(script) {

        console.log('third script is loaded');
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });

  })

});
⬆ Back to Top

What is promise chaining
The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 2
  return result * 3;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 6
  return result * 4;

});
In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
After that .then handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result * 2.
After that the value passed to the next .then handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result * 3.
Finally the value passed to the last .then handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result * 4.
⬆ Back to Top

What is promise.all
Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
Note: Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of the race method in promise
Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(value) {
  console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});

What is a strict mode in javascript
Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression "use strict"; instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

⬆ Back to Top

Why do you need strict mode
Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

⬆ Back to Top

How do you declare strict mode
The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

"use strict";
x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

x = 3.14;       // This will not cause an error.
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error
}
⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of double exclamation
The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, true. For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

let isIE8 = false;
isIE8 = !! navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/));  // returns either an Array or null
Note: The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of the delete operator
The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

var user= {name: "John", age:20};
delete user.age;

console.log(user); // {name: "John"}
⬆ Back to Top

What is the typeof operator
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

typeof "John Abraham"     // Returns "string"
typeof (1 + 2)        // Returns "number"
⬆ Back to Top

What is undefined property
The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

var user;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof(user)) //undefined
Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

user = undefined
⬆ Back to Top

What is null value
The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object. You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

var user = null;
console.log(typeof(user)) //object
⬆ Back to Top

What is the difference between null and undefined
Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

Null	Undefined
It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.	It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
Type of null is object	Type of undefined is undefined
The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference.	The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
Indicates the absence of a value for a variable	Indicates absence of variable itself
Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations	Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations

What is the difference between window and document
Below are the main differences between window and document,

Window	Document
It is the root level element in any web page	It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM)
By default window object is available implicitly in the page	You can access it via window.document or document.
It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location	It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc
⬆ Back to Top

How do you access history in javascript
The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.

function goBack() {
  window.history.back()
}
function goForward() {
  window.history.forward()
}
Note: You can also access history without window prefix.

How do you detect caps lock key turned on or not
The mouseEvent getModifierState() is used to return a boolean value that indicates whether the specified modifier key is activated or not. The modifiers such as CapsLock, ScrollLock and NumLock are activated when they are clicked, and deactivated when they are clicked again.

Let's take an input element to detect the CapsLock on/off behavior with an example,

    <input type="password" onmousedown="enterInput(event)">
      
    <p id="feedback"></p>
      
    <script>
    function enterInput(e) {
      var flag = e.getModifierState("CapsLock");
      if(flag) {
          document.getElementById("feedback").innerHTML = "CapsLock activated";
          
      } else {
          document.getElementById("feedback").innerHTML = "CapsLock not activated";
      }
    }
    </script>

What is isNaN
The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

isNaN('Hello') //true
isNaN('100') //false

What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables
Below are the major differences between undeclared and undefined variables,

undeclared	undefined
These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared	These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value
If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered	If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

What are global variables
Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

msg = "Hello" // var is missing, it becomes global variable
⬆ Back to Top

What are the problems with global variables
The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

⬆ Back to Top

What is NaN property
The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

Math.sqrt(-1)
parseInt("Hello")
⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of isFinite function
The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

isFinite(Infinity);  // false
isFinite(NaN);       // false
isFinite(-Infinity); // false

isFinite(100);         // true

What is an event flow
Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object. There are two ways of event flow

Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)
⬆ Back to Top

What is event bubbling
Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.

What is event capturing
Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

What is the difference between native, host and user objects
Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec. Host objects are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects. User objects are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

Pros:

It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)
Cons:

What is the difference between an attribute and a property
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

<input type="text" value="Name:">
You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good evening

What is same-origin policy
The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

What is the purpose of void 0
Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an <a> element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression. For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

<a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">Click Me!</a>

Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

What are events
Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can react on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

Web page has finished loading
Input field was changed
Button was clicked
Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
   <script>
     function greeting() {
       alert('Hello! Good morning');
     }
   </script>

What is the use of preventDefault method
The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

document.getElementById("link").addEventListener("click", function(event){
 event.preventDefault();
});
Note: Remember that not all events are cancelable.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the use of stopPropagation method
The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)

<p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
<div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
  <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
</div>

<script>
function firstFunc(event) {
  alert("DIV 1");
  event.stopPropagation();
}

function secondFunc() {
  alert("DIV 2");
}

Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded
JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes.

What is an event delegation
Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

For example, if you wanted to detect field changes in inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

var form = document.querySelector('#registration-form');

// Listen for changes to fields inside the form
form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {

// Log the field that was changed
console.log(event.target);

}, false);

Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

The data is in name/value pairs
The data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

What is the purpose JSON stringify
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

var userJSON = {'name': 'John', age: 31}
var userString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
⬆ Back to Top

How do you parse JSON string
When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
console.log(userJSON);// {name: "John", age: 31}

What is the purpose of clearTimeout method
The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

<script>
var msg;
function greeting() {
   alert('Good morning');
}
function start() {
  msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

<script>
var msg;
function greeting() {
   alert('Good morning');

How do you check whether a string contains a substring
There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

Using includes: ES6 provided String.prototype.includes method to test a string contains a substring
var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
mainString.includes(subString)
Using indexOf: In an ES5 or older environment, you can use String.prototype.indexOf which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.
var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1
Using RegEx: The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(RegExp.test), which allows for testing for against regular expressions
var mainString = "hello", regex = /hell/;
regex.test(mainString)

How do you check if a key exists in an object
You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

Using in operator: You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not
"key" in obj
and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

!("key" in obj)
Using hasOwnProperty method: You can use hasOwnProperty to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)
obj.hasOwnProperty("key") // true
Using undefined comparison: If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.
const user = {
  name: 'John'
};

How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object
You can use the for-in loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using hasOwnProperty method.

var object = {
    "k1": "value1",
    "k2": "value2",
    "k3": "value3"
};

for (var key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
    }
}
⬆ Back to Top

How do you test for an empty object
There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

Using Object entries(ECMA 7+): You can use object entries length along with constructor type.
Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
Using Object keys(ECMA 5+): You can use object keys length along with constructor type.
Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5): You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.
function isEmpty(obj) {
  for(var prop in obj) {
    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});

What is an arguments object
The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

function sum() {
    var total = 0;
    for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
        total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}

sum(1, 2, 3) // returns 6
Note: You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase
You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
    return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}

How do you display the current date in javascript
You can use new Date() to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;
document.write(today);

How do you compare two date objects
You need to use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead of comparison operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)

var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(d1);
console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
console.log(d1 === d2); // False

How do you check if a string starts with another string
You can use ECMAScript 6's String.prototype.startsWith() method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,

"Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
"Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false

How do you trim a string in javascript
JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

"  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

if (!String.prototype.trim) {
    (function() {
        // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
        var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
        String.prototype.trim = function() {
            return this.replace(rtrim, '');
        };
    })();

How do you add a key value pair in javascript
There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

var object = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2
};
Using dot notation: This solution is useful when you know the name of the property
object.key3 = "value3";
Using square bracket notation: This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.
obj["key3"] = "value3";

Is the !-- notation represents a special operator
No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

A logical not (!)
A prefix decrement (--)
At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

How do you assign default values to variables
You can use the logical or operator || in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

var a = b || c;
As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

How do you define multiline strings
You can define multiline string literals using the '\' character followed by line terminator.

var str = "This is a \
very lengthy \
sentence!";
But if you have a space after the '\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.

Can we define properties for functions
Yes, We can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.

fn = function(x) {
   //Function code goes here
}

What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function
You can use function.length syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of sum function to calculate the sum of numbers,

function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4){
    return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
}
sum.length // 4 is the number of parameters expected.

What are break and continue statements
The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) { break; }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) { continue; }
    text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
⬆ Back to Top

What are js labels
The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

var i, j;

loop1:
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   loop2:
   for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      if (i === j) {
         continue loop1;
      }
      console.log('i = ' + i + ', j = ' + j);
   }
}

// Output is:
//   "i = 1, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 1"

What are the recommendations to create new object
It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using new Object(). Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.

Assign {} instead of new Object()
Assign "" instead of new String()
Assign 0 instead of new Number()
Assign false instead of new Boolean()
Assign [] instead of new Array()
Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
Assign function (){} instead of new Function()
You can define them as an example,

var v1 = {};
var v2 = "";
var v3 = 0;
var v4 = false;
var v5 = [];
var v6 = /()/;
var v7 = function(){};

How do you generate random integers
You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
Note: Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

Can you write a random integers function to print integers with in a range
Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

function randomInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min;
}
randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000

What is tree shaking
Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the need of tree shaking
Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

What is a Regular Expression
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

/pattern/modifiers;
For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

/John/i
⬆ Back to Top

What are the string methods available in Regular expression
Regular Expressions has two string methods: search() and replace(). The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
The replace() method is used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.replace(/John/i, "Buttler"); // Hello Buttler
⬆ Back to Top

What are modifiers in regular expression
Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list down some of the modifiers,

Modifier	Description
i	Perform case-insensitive matching
g	Perform a global match rather than stops at first match
m	Perform multiline matching
Let's take an example of global modifier,

var text = "Learn JS one by one";
var pattern = /one/g;
var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one

What are regular expression patterns
Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

Brackets: These are used to find a range of characters. For example, below are some use cases,
[abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
[0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
(a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
Metacharacters: These are characters with a special meaning For example, below are some use cases,
\d: Used to find a digit
\s: Used to find a whitespace character
\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
Quantifiers: These are useful to define quantities For example, below are some use cases,
n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
n*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

Give an example where do you really need semicolon
It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

// define a function
var fn = function () {
    //...
} // semicolon missing at this line

// then execute some code inside a closure
(function () {
    //...
})();
and it will be interpreted as

var fn = function () {
    //...
}(function () {
    //...
})();
In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

What is a freeze method
The freeze() method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

const obj = {
  prop: 100
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop); //100
Note: It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

How do you detect javascript disabled in the page
You can use the <noscript> tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside <noscript> gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

<script type="javascript">
    // JS related code goes here
</script>
<noscript>
    <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>

What are various operators supported by javascript
An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

Arithmetic Operators: Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
Comparison Operators: Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
Logical Operators: Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
Assignment Operators: Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
Ternary Operators: It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
typeof Operator: It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like typeof variable

What is a rest parameter
Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
  // ...
}
For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

function total(…args){
let sum = 0;
for(let i of args){
sum+=i;
}
return sum;
}
console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
Note: Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

⬆ Back to Top

What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument
The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

function someFunc(a,…b,c){
//You code goes here
return;
}

}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6

How do you determine whether object is frozen or not
Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

If it is not extensible.
If all of its properties are non-configurable.
If all its data properties are non-writable. The usage is going to be as follows,
const object = {
   property: 'Welcome JS world'
};
Object.freeze(object);
console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
⬆ Back to Top

How do you determine two values same or not using object
The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

Object.is('hello', 'hello');     // true
Object.is(window, window);   // true
Object.is([], []) // false
Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

both undefined
both null
both true or both false
both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
both the same object (means both object have same reference)
both numbers and both +0 both -0 both NaN both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

What is the purpose of using object is method
Some of the applications of Object's is method are follows,

It is used for comparison of two strings.
It is used for comparison of two numbers.
It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
It is used for comparison of two objects.

How do you copy properties from one object to other
You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. The syntax would be as below,

Object.assign(target, ...sources)
Let's take example with one source and one target object,

const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
As observed in the above code, there is a common property(b) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

What is a proxy object
The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc. The syntax would be as follows,

var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
Let's take an example of proxy object,

var handler = {
    get: function(obj, prop) {
        return prop in obj ?
            obj[prop] :
            100;
    }
};

var p = new Proxy({}, handler);
p.a = 10;
p.b = null;

console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
console.log('c' in p, p.c); // false, 100
In the above code, it uses get handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it

What is the purpose of seal method
The Object.seal() method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method

 const object = {
    property: 'Welcome JS world'
 };
 Object.seal(object);
 object.property = 'Welcome to object world';
 console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
 delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
 console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world

It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
It is used to make an object immutable.
⬆ Back to Top

What are the differences between freeze and seal methods
If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

How do you determine if an object is sealed or not
The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

If it is not extensible.
If all of its properties are non-configurable.
If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable). Let's see it in the action
const object = {
property: 'Hello, Good morning'
};

Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

console.log(Object.isSealed(object));      // checking whether the object is sealed or not

How do you get enumerable key and value pairs
The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

const object = {
  a: 'Good morning',
  b: 100
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
                                   // b: 100
}
Note: The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method
The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

 const object = {
   a: 'Good morning',
   b: 100
 };

 for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
   console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'

How can you get the list of keys of any object
You can use the Object.keys() method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

const user = {
  name: 'John',
  gender: 'male',
  age: 40
};

console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']

How do you create an object with prototype
The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

 const user = {
   name: 'John',
   printInfo: function () {
     console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
   }
 };

 const admin = Object.create(user);

 admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

 admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick

What is a WeakSet
WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

new WeakSet([iterable]);
Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

var ws = new WeakSet();
var user = {};
ws.add(user);
ws.has(user);    // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
ws.has(user);    // false, user has been removed

What are the differences between WeakSet and Set
The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it. Other differences are,

Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
WeakSet is not iterable.

add(value): A new object is appended with the given value to the weakset
delete(value): Deletes the value from the WeakSet collection.
has(value): It returns true if the value is present in the WeakSet Collection, otherwise it returns false.
Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,

var weakSetObject = new WeakSet();
var firstObject = {};
var secondObject = {};

  language : "en",
  get lang() {
    return this.language;
  }
  set lang(lang) {

How do you define property on Object constructor
The Object.defineProperty() static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,

const newObject = {};

Object.defineProperty(newObject, 'newProperty', {
  value: 100,
  writable: false
});

console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting

Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method
Yes, You can use the Object.defineProperty() method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and subtract properties,

var obj = {counter : 0};

// Define getters
Object.defineProperty(obj, "increment", {
  get : function () {this.counter++;}
});
Object.defineProperty(obj, "decrement", {
  get : function () {this.counter--;}
});

// Define setters
Object.defineProperty(obj, "add", {
  set : function (value) {this.counter += value;}
});
Object.defineProperty(obj, "subtract", {
  set : function (value) {this.counter -= value;}
});

obj.add = 10;
obj.subtract = 5;
console.log(obj.increment); //6
console.log(obj.decrement); //5

What is the purpose of switch-case
The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    .
    .
    case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    default:
        statementDefault;
}
The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case
Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,

The expression can be of type either number or string.
Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.
The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.

What is an Iterator
An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a next() method which returns an object with two properties: value (the next value in the sequence) and done (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

How does synchronous iteration works
Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

Iterable: It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator. Iterator: It is an object returned by invoking [Symbol.iterator]() on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via next() method one by one. IteratorResult: It is an object returned by next() method. The object contains two properties; the value property contains an iterated element and the done property determines whether the element is the last element or not.

Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,

const iterable = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'one', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'two', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'three', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'undefined, done: true }

What is an event loop
The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function has finished executing the code. Note: It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

What is call stack
Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls in the program. It has two major actions,

Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.
Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

function hungry() {
   eatFruits();
}
function eatFruits() {
   return "I'm eating fruits";
}

// Invoke the `hungry` function
hungry();
The above code processed in a call stack as below,

Add the hungry() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
Add the eatFruits() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
Delete the eatFruits() function from our call stack list.
Delete the hungry() function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

How do you reversing an array
You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,

let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]

How do you find min and max value in an array
You can use Math.min and Math.max methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
  return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
}
function findMax(arr) {
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));
⬆ Back to Top

How do you find min and max values without Math functions
You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

 var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
 function findMin(arr) {
   var length = arr.length
   var min = Infinity;
   while (length--) {
     if (arr[length] < min) {
       min = arr[len];
     }
   }
   return min;
 }

 function findMax(arr) {
   var length = arr.length
   var max = -Infinity;
   while (len--) {
     if (arr[length] > max) {
       max = arr[length];
     }
   }
   return max;
 }

 console.log(findMin(marks));
 console.log(findMax(marks));

What is an empty statement and purpose of it
The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

// Initialize an array a
for(int i=0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0) ;

How do you get metadata of a module
You can use the import.meta object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

<script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }

What is a comma operator
The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

var x = 1;
x = (x++, x);

console.log(x); // 2
⬆ Back to Top

What is the advantage of a comma operator
It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

function myFunction() {
   var a = 1;
   return (a += 10, a); // 11
}

What is typescript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

npm install -g typescript
Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

function greeting(name: string): string {
   return "Hello, " + name;
}

let user = "Sudheer";

console.log(greeting(user));
The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

feature	typescript	javascript
Language paradigm	Object oriented programming language	Scripting language
Typing support	Supports static typing	It has dynamic typing
Modules	Supported	Not supported
Interface	It has interfaces concept	Doesn't support interfaces
Optional parameters	Functions support optional parameters	No support of optional parameters for functions

What are the advantages of typescript over javascript
Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

What is an object initializer
An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.

var initObject = {a: 'John', b: 50, c: {}};

console.log(initObject.a); // John
⬆ Back to Top

What is a constructor method
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

class Employee {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}

var employeeObject = new Employee();

console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
⬆ Back to Top

What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class
The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a SyntaxError error.

 class Employee {
   constructor() {
     this.name = "John";
   }
   constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
     this.age = 30;
   }
 }

 var employeeObject = new Employee();

 console.log(employeeObject.name);
⬆ Back to Top

How do you call the constructor of a parent class
You can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that super() must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(length) {
    super(length, length);
    this.name = 'Square';
  }

  get area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  set area(value) {
    this.area = value;
  }
}
⬆ Back to Top

How do you get the prototype of an object
You can use the Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal prototype property. If there are no inherited properties then null value is returned.

const newPrototype = {};
const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
⬆ Back to Top

What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method
In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an Object.

// ES5
Object.getPrototypeOf('James'); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
// ES2015
Object.getPrototypeOf('James'); // String.prototype
⬆ Back to Top

How do you set prototype of one object to another
You can use the Object.setPrototypeOf() method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal Prototype property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
⬆ Back to Top

How do you check whether an object can be extendable or not
The Object.isExtensible() method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

const newObject = {};
console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
Note: By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

⬆ Back to Top

How do you prevent an object to extend
The Object.preventExtensions() method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

const newObject = {};
Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

try {
  Object.defineProperty(newObject, 'newProperty', { // Adding new property
    value: 100
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
}
⬆ Back to Top

What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible
You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,

Object.preventExtensions
Object.seal
Object.freeze
var newObject = {};

Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false
⬆ Back to Top

How do you define multiple properties on an object
The Object.defineProperties() method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

const newObject = {};

Object.defineProperties(newObject, {
  newProperty1: {
    value: 'John',
    writable: true
  },
  newProperty2: {}
});

What Is Obfuscation in javascript
Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it. Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

function greeting() {
   console.log('Hello, welcome to JS world');
}
And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('2 1(){0.3(\'4, 7 6 5 8\')}',9,9,'console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world'.split('|'),0,{}))
⬆ Back to Top

Why do you need Obfuscation
Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,

The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.
It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others
Reverse engineering is highly difficult
The download time will be reduced

How do you perform form validation using javascript
JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted. Lets' perform user login in an html form,

<form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
User name: <input type="text" name="uname">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
And the validation on user login is below,

function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
    return false;
  }
}
⬆ Back to Top

How do you perform form validation without javascript
You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the required attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

<form method="post">
  <input type="text" name="uname" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Note: Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation
The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element. Let's take an user login form with DOM validations
function myFunction() {
  var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
  if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
    document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = userName.validationMessage;
  } else {
    document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Entered a valid username";
  }
}

What are the available constraint validation DOM properties
Below are the list of some of the constraint validation DOM properties available,

validity: It provides a list of boolean properties related to the validity of an input element.
validationMessage: It displays the message when the validity is false.
willValidate: It indicates if an input element will be validated or not.
⬆ Back to Top

What are the list of validity properties
The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.

customError: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.
patternMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.
rangeOverflow: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.
rangeUnderflow: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.
stepMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.
tooLong: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.
typeMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.
valueMissing: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.
valid: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.
⬆ Back to Top

Give an example usage of rangeOverflow property
If an element's value is greater than its max attribute then rangeOverflow property returns true. For example, the below form submission throws an error if the value is more than 100,

<input id="age" type="number" max="100">
<button onclick="myOverflowFunction()">OK</button>
function myOverflowFunction() {
  if (document.getElementById("age").validity.rangeOverflow) {
    alert("The mentioned age is not allowed");
  }

Is enums feature available in javascript
No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,

var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})

How do you list all properties of an object
You can use the Object.getOwnPropertyNames() method which returns an array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's the usage of it in an example,

const newObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
};

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));  ["a", "b", "c"]
⬆ Back to Top

How do you get property descriptors of an object
You can use the Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors() method which returns all own property descriptors of a given object. The example usage of this method is below,

 const newObject = {
   a: 1,
   b: 2,
   c: 3
 };
const descriptorsObject = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(newObject);
console.log(descriptorsObject.a.writable); //true
console.log(descriptorsObject.a.configurable); //true
console.log(descriptorsObject.a.enumerable); //true
console.log(descriptorsObject.a.value); // 1

What are the attributes provided by a property descriptor
A property descriptor is a record which has the following attributes

value: The value associated with the property
writable: Determines whether the value associated with the property can be changed or not
configurable: Returns true if the type of this property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the corresponding object.
enumerable: Determines whether the property appears during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object or not.
set: A function which serves as a setter for the property
get: A function which serves as a getter for the property

How do you extend classes
The extends keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,

class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,

 class Square extends Rectangle {
   constructor(length) {
     super(length, length);
     this.name = 'Square';
   }

   get area() {
     return this.width * this.height;
   }

   set area(value) {
     this.area = value;
   }

How do I modify the url without reloading the page
The window.location.url property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the history.pushState() and history.replaceState() methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

window.history.pushState('page2', 'Title', '/page2.html');

How do you check whether an array includes a particular value or not
The Array#includes() method is used to determine whether an array includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) within an array.

var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true

var stringArray = ['green', 'yellow', 'blue'];
console.log(stringArray.includes('blue')); //true

How do you compare scalar arrays
You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalar(compared directly using ===) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,

const arrayFirst = [1,2,3,4,5];
const arraySecond = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length && arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])); // true
If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,

const arrayFirst = [2,3,1,4,5];
const arraySecond = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length && arrayFirst.sort().every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])); //true

Does JavaScript supports namespace
JavaScript doesn’t support namespace by default. So if you create any element(function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

function func1() {
    console.log("This is a first definition");

}
function func1() {
    console.log("This is a second definition");
}
func1(); // This is a second definition
It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespace will solve the name collision problem.

⬆ Back to Top

How do you declare namespace
Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects , IIFE to create namespaces.

Using Object Literal Notation: Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation
var namespaceOne = {
   function func1() {
       console.log("This is a first definition");
   }
}
var namespaceTwo = {
     function func1() {
         console.log("This is a second definition");
     }
 }
namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression): The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.
(function() {
 function fun1(){
   console.log("This is a first definition");
   } fun1();
}());

(function() {
    function fun1(){
       console.log("This is a second definition");
   } fun1();
 }());
Using a block and a let/const declaration: In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.
 {
  let myFunction= function fun1(){
  console.log("This is a first definition");
  }
  myFunction();
 }
  //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

 {
  let myFunction= function fun1(){
  console.log("This is a second definition");
  }
  myFunction();
 }
  //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

       var fileReference = document.createElement("link")
       fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
       fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
       fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
  } else if (filetype == "js") { // External JavaScript file
       var fileReference = document.createElement('script');
       fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

$(document).ready(function(){ // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
    alert('Welcome to jQuery world');
});

Why do we call javascript as dynamic language
JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

age  = 'old'; // age is a string now
age  = true;  // age is a boolean

Why do you need to avoid with statement
JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.

a.b.c.greeting   = 'welcome';
a.b.c.age = 32;
Using with it turns this into:

with(a.b.c) {
        greeting   = "welcome";
        age = 32;
}
But this with statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.

What is the output of below for loops
for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // global scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // block scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}
The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

Explanation: Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the var keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is 4 4 4 4.

Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the let keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is 0 1 2 3.

Multi-line Strings
Destructuring Assignment
Enhanced Object Literals
Promises
Classes
Modules

What is ES6
ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

Can I redeclare let and const variables
No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
Explanation: The variable declaration with var keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

var name = 'John';
function myFunc() {
    var name = 'Nick';
    var name = 'Abraham'; // Re-assigned in the same function block
    alert(name); // Abraham
}
myFunc();
alert(name); // John
The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

let name = 'John';
function myFunc() {
    let name = 'Nick';
    let name = 'Abraham'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
    alert(name);
}

myFunc();
alert(name);

Is const variable makes the value immutable
No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

const userList = [];
userList.push('John'); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
console.log(userList); // ['John']
⬆ Back to Top

What are default parameters
In E5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

//ES5
var calculateArea = function(height, width) {
   height =  height || 50;
   width = width || 60;

   return width * height;
}
console.log(calculateArea()); //300
The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

//ES6
var calculateArea = function(height = 50, width = 60) {
   return width * height;
}

console.log(calculateArea()); //300
⬆ Back to Top

What are template literals
Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes. In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`
In ES5, you need break string like below,

var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
Note: You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

⬆ Back to Top

How do you write multi-line strings in template literals
In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

console.log('This is string sentence 1\n' +
'This is string sentence 2');
Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

console.log(`This is string sentence
'This is string sentence 2`);
⬆ Back to Top

What are nesting templates
The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
 `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? 'submit' : 'disabled'}` }`;
You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

//Without nesting templates
 const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
  (user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;
⬆ Back to Top

What are tagged templates
Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

var user1 = 'John';
var skill1 = 'JavaScript';
var experience1 = 15;

var user2 = 'Kane';
var skill2 = 'JavaScript';
var experience2 = 5;

function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
  var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
  var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
  var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

  var expertiseStr;
  if (experienceExp > 10){
    expertiseStr = 'expert developer';
  } else if(skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
    expertiseStr = 'senior developer';
  } else {
    expertiseStr = 'junior developer';
  }

  return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
}

var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${ user1 } is a/an ${ experience1 } in ${skill1}`;
var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${ user2 } is a/an ${ experience2 } in ${skill2}`;

console.log(output1);// Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
console.log(output2);// Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
⬆ Back to Top

What are raw strings
ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the String.raw() method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

var calculationString = String.raw `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is 10
If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
console.log(calculationString);
// The sum of numbers is
// 10
Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function

function tag(strings) {
   console.log(strings.raw[0]);
}
⬆ Back to Top

What is destructuring assignment
The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

var [one, two, three] = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MARCH'];

console.log(one); // "JAN"
console.log(two); // "FEB"
console.log(three); // "MARCH"
and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

var {name, age} = {name: 'John', age: 32};

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 32
⬆ Back to Top

What are default values in destructuring assignment
A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

Arrays destructuring:

var x, y, z;

[x=2, y=4, z=6] = [10];
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
Objects destructuring:

var {x=2, y=4, z=6} = {x: 10};

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
⬆ Back to Top

How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment
If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

var x = 10, y = 20;

[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x); // 20
console.log(y); // 10
⬆ Back to Top

What are enhanced object literals
Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.

//ES6
var x = 10, y = 20
obj = { x, y }
console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
//ES5
var x = 10, y = 20
obj = { x : x, y : y}
console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}

What are dynamic imports
The dynamic imports using import() function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in stage4 proposal. The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience. The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

import('./Module').then(Module => Module.method());
⬆ Back to Top

What are the use cases for dynamic imports
Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,

Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser
if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
    import(···)
    .then(···);
}
Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.
import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);
Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

What are typed arrays
Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 8 Typed array types,

Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers
For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

const a = new Int8Array();
// You can pre-allocate n bytes
const bytes = 1024
const a = new Int8Array(bytes)

What is collation
Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,

Comparison:
var list = [ "ä", "a", "z" ]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
console.log(l10nDE.compare("ä", "z") === -1); // true
console.log(l10nSV.compare("ä", "z") === +1); // true
Sorting:
var list = [ "ä", "a", "z" ]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)) // [ "a", "ä", "z" ]
console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)) // [ "a", "z", "ä" ]
⬆ Back to Top

What is for...of statement
The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for (let value of arrayIterable) {
  value ++;
  console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
}
⬆ Back to Top

What is the output of below spread operator array
[...'John Resig']
The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g'] Explanation: The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

Is PostMessage secure
Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

⬆ Back to Top

What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard
The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

targetWindow.postMessage(message, '*');
⬆ Back to Top

How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers
Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin http://www.some-sender.com on receiver side www.some-receiver.com,

//Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
    if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
         console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
   }
});
⬆ Back to Top

Can I avoid using postMessages completely
You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

⬆ Back to Top

Is postMessages synchronous
The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

Is JavaScript faster than server side script
Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side script. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

How do you get the status of a checkbox
You can apply the checked property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is True means the checkbox is checked otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below,

  <input type="checkbox" name="checkboxname" value="Agree"> Agree the conditions<br>
console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false

Whereas String.fromCharCode() method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

String.fromCharCode(65,66,67); // returns 'ABC'

What is ArrayBuffer
An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,

let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.

//Create a DataView referring to the buffer
 let view = new DataView(buffer);

What is the output of below string expression
console.log("Welcome to JS world"[0])
The output of the above expression is "W". Explanation: The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character "W" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.

⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of Error object
The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

try {
  if(withdraw > balance)
  throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.name + ': ' + e.message);
}
⬆ Back to Top

What is the purpose of EvalError object
The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global eval() function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,

new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,

try {
  throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // "Eval function error", "EvalError", "someFile.js"

What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode
When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script

When you use Octal syntax
var n = 022;
Using with statement
When you use delete operator on a variable name
Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name
When you use newly reserved keywords
When you declare a function in a block
if (someCondition) { function f() {} }
Hence, the errors from above cases are helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument
Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  console.log(arguments[0]) // "argument1"
  console.log(arguments[1]) // "argument2"
  console.log(arguments[2]) // "argument3"
}

What is the purpose of some method in arrays
The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,

var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7, 8, 9, 10];

var odd = element => element % 2 !== 0;

console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)

How do you combine two or more arrays
The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

  var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
  var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
  var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
  console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears

What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy
There are two ways to copy an object,

Shallow Copy: Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

Example

var empDetails = {
  name: "John", age: 25, expertise: "Software Developer"
}
to create a duplicate

var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails    //Shallow copying!
if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson"
The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

Deep copy: A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

Example

var empDetails = {
  name: "John", age: 25, expertise: "Software Developer"
}
Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
  name: empDetails.name,
  age: empDetails.age,
  expertise: empDetails.expertise
}
Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails

How do you create specific number of copies of a string
The repeat() method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification. Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

'Hello'.repeat(4);  // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression
The matchAll() method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,

let regexp = /Hello(\d?))/g;
let greeting = 'Hello1Hello2Hello3';

let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

console.log(greetingList[0]); //Hello1
console.log(greetingList[1]); //Hello2

How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending
The trim method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use trimStart/trimLeft and trimEnd/trimRight methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

var greeting = '   Hello, Goodmorning!   ';

console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"

What is the output of below console statement with unary operator
Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

console.log(+ 'Hello');
The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

Does javascript uses mixins
Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one [[prototype]] for an object.

But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.

Say for instance, we've two classes User and CleanRoom. Suppose we need to add CleanRoom functionality to User, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.

// mixin
let cleanRoomMixin = {
     cleanRoom() {
     alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);
},
sayBye() {
     alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
}
};

// usage:
class User {
     constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
     }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

// now User can clean the room
new User("Dude").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!

What is a thunk function
A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

const add = (x,y) => x + y;

const thunk = () => add(2,3);

thunk() // 5

What are asynchronous thunks
The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

function fetchData(fn){
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => fn(json))
}

const asyncThunk = function (){
   return fetchData(function getData(data){
      console.log(data)
  })
}

asyncThunk()
The getData function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

What is the output of below function calls
Code snippet:

const circle = {
  radius: 20,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius
};
console.log(circle.diameter()); console.log(circle.perimeter());

Output:

The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The this keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

How to remove all line breaks from a string
The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.

function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
    return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
}
In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

What is the difference between reflow and repaint
A repaint occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A reflow involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

console.log(['a'] + ['b']);  // "ab"
console.log([] + []); // ""
console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.

What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values
If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

console.log(+null); // 0
console.log(+undefined);// NaN
console.log(+false); // 0
console.log(+NaN); // NaN
console.log(+""); // 0

How do you create self string using special characters
The self string can be formed with the combination of []()!+ characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.

Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1
By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions

![] + [] === "false"
+!+[] === 1
Now the character pattern would be created as below,

      s               e               l               f
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +
(![] + [])[+[]]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How do you remove falsy values from an array
You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

const myArray = [false, null, 1,5, undefined]
myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);

How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays
Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
    const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
    return flattened.some(item => Array.isArray(item)) ? flattenMultiArray(flattened) : flattened;
 }
const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];

What are wrapper objects
Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.

let name = "john";

console.log(name.toUpperCase());  // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());
i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

How to cancel a fetch request
Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new AbortController from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls. The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

Create an AbortController instance
Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,
const controller = new AbortController();
const { signal } = controller;

fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
    console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
}).catch(e => {
    if(e.name === "AbortError") {
        // We know it's been canceled!
    }
});

fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
    console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
}).catch(e => {
     if(e.name === "AbortError") {
         // We know it's been canceled!
      }
});

// Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests

What is web speech API
Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,

SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text): It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the SpeechRecognition interface. The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,
window.SpeechRecognition = window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition;  // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
recognition.onresult = (event) => { // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
  const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  console.log(speechToText);
}
recognition.start();
In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech): It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the SpeechSynthesis interface. For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,
if('speechSynthesis' in window){
    var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World!');
    speech.lang = 'en-US';
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
}
The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console. Note: This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

What is minimum timeout throttling
Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously. Browsers: They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals. Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms. Nodejs: They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1. The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.

function runMeFirst() {
    console.log('My script is initialized');
}
setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
console.log('Script loaded');
and the output would be in

Script loaded
My script is initialized
If you don't use setTimeout, the order of logs will be sequential.

function runMeFirst() {
   console.log('My script is initialized');
}
runMeFirst();
console.log('Script loaded');
and the output is,

My script is initialized
Script loaded

How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file
It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in our TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is declare keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called customLibrary that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called customLibrary in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

declare var customLibrary;
In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the customLibrary variable as any type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

What is heap
Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime. Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

What is an event table
Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table. It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

What is the difference between shim and polyfill
A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9). Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type
In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

var myPrimitive = 30;
var myNonPrimitive = {};
function isPrimitive(val) {
    return Object(val) !== val;
}

isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration
The functions which are created with Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

Let's see this difference with an example,

Function Constructor:

var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
    var a = 200;
    return new Function('return a;');
}
console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
Function declaration:

var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
    var a = 200;
    return function func() {
        return a;
    }
}

const observable = new Observable(observer => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    observer.next('Message from a Observable!');
  }, 3000);
});

observable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));

What is an async function
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more await expressions.

  let data = await fetch('http://someapi.com/users'); // pause until fetch returns
  console.log(data)
}
logger();
It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

How do you prevent promises swallowing errors
While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

Promise.resolve('promised value').then(function() {
      throw new Error('error');
});

Promise.reject('error value').catch(function() {
      throw new Error('error');
});

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      throw new Error('error');
});
But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

Add catch block at the end of each chain: You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

Promise.resolve('promised value').then(function() {
    throw new Error('error');
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.error(error.stack);
});
But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

Add done method: You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

Promise.resolve('promised value').done(function() {
    throw new Error('error');
});
Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write done block as below,

getDataFromHttp()
  .then(function(result) {
    return processDataAsync(result);
  })
  .done(function(processed) {
    displayData(processed);
  });
In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove done block as below,

 getDataFromHttp()
   .then(function(result) {
     return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
   })
and then you forgot to add done block to then block leads to silent errors.

Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird: Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function(error){
    throw error;
});
and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

Promise.reject('error value').catch(function() {});

How do you make an object iterable in javascript
By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a Symbol.iterator property on it.

Let's demonstrate this with an example,

const collection = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    const values = Object.keys(this);
    let i = 0;
    return {
      next: () => {
        return {
          value: this[values[i++]],
          done: i > values.length
        }
      }
    };
  }
};

const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next());    // → {value: 1, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next());    // → {value: 2, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next());    // → {value: 3, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next());    // → {value: undefined, done: true}
The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

 const collection = {
   one: 1,
   two: 2,
   three: 3,
   [Symbol.iterator]: function * () {
     for (let key in this) {
       yield this[key];
     }
   }
 };
 const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
 console.log(iterator.next());    // {value: 1, done: false}
 console.log(iterator.next());    // {value: 2, done: false}
 console.log(iterator.next());    // {value: 3, done: false}
 console.log(iterator.next());    // {value: undefined, done: true}

What is a Proper Tail Call
First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas Proper tail call(PTC) is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto n * factorial(n - 1)

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
console.log(factorial(5)); //120
But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return acc
  }
  return factorial(n - 1, n * acc)
}
console.log(factorial(5)); //120
The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

How to detect if a function is called as constructor
You can use new.target pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
For function calls, new.target is undefined.
function Myfunc() {
   if (new.target) {
      console.log('called with new');
   } else {
      console.log('not called with new');
   }
}

new Myfunc(); // called with new
Myfunc(); // not called with new
Myfunc.call({}); not called with new

What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter
There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter
Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.

What are the different kinds of generators
There are five kinds of generators,

Generator function declaration:

 function* myGenFunc() {
      yield 1;
      yield 2;
      yield 3;
 }
 const genObj = myGenFunc();
Generator function expressions:

const myGenFunc = function* () {
       yield 1;
       yield 2;
       yield 3;
};
const genObj = myGenFunc();
Generator method definitions in object literals:

 const myObj = {
     * myGeneratorMethod() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
     }
 };
 const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();
Generator method definitions in class:

  class MyClass {
     * myGeneratorMethod() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
     }
  }
  const myObject = new MyClass();
  const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();
Generator as a computed property:

const SomeObj = {
  *[Symbol.iterator] () {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  }
}

console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]

What are the built-in iterables
Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

Arrays and TypedArrays
Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
Sets: iterates over their elements
arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
DOM collection such as NodeList

What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements
Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.
Let's explain this difference with an example,

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

arr.newProp = 'newVlue';

// key are the property keys
for (let key in arr) {
  console.log(key);
}

// value are the property values
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}
Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

How do you define instance and non-instance properties
The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined insider constructor as below,

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

Person.staticAge = 30;
Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;

What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?
isNaN: The global function isNaN converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
Number.isNaN: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.
Let's see the difference with an example,

isNaN(‘hello’);   // true
Number.isNaN('hello'); // false

How to invoke an IIFE without any extra brackets?
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) requires a pair of parenthesis to wrap the function which contains set of statements.

(function(dt) { 
   console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString()); 
 })(new Date()); 
Since both IIFE and void operator discard the result of an expression, you can avoid the extra brackets using void operator for IIFE as below,

 void function(dt) { 
   console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString()); 
 }(new Date());

Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?
You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

const weather = function getWeather(temp) {
   switch(true) {
       case temp < 0: return 'freezing';
       case temp < 10: return 'cold';
       case temp < 24: return 'cool';
       default: return 'unknown';
   }
   }(10);

How do style the console output using CSS?
You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red the color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,

console.log("%cThis is a red text", "color:red");
It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text

console.log("%cThis is a red text with bigger font", "color:red; font-size:20px");

What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?
It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.

console.log(null ?? true); // true
console.log(false ?? true); // false
console.log(undefined ?? true); // true

How do you group and nest console output?
The console.group() can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.

For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:

console.group('User Details');
console.log('name: Sudheer Jonna');
console.log('job: Software Developer');

// Nested Group
console.group('Address');
console.log('Street: Commonwealth');
console.log('City: Los Angeles');
console.log('State: California');

console.groupEnd();
You can also use console.groupCollapsed() instead of console.group() if you want the groups to be collapsed by default.

What is the difference between dense and sparse arrays?
An array contians items at each index starting from first(0) to last(array.length - 1) is called as Dense array. Whereas if at least one item is missing at any index, the array is called as sparse.

Let's see the below two kind of arrays,

const avengers = ['Ironman', 'Hulk', 'CaptainAmerica'];
console.log(avengers[0]); // 'Ironman'
console.log(avengers[1]); // 'Hulk'
console.log(avengers[2]); // 'CaptainAmerica'
console.log(avengers.length); // 3

const justiceLeague = ['Superman', 'Aquaman', ,'Batman'];
console.log(justiceLeague[0]); // 'Superman'
console.log(justiceLeague[1]); // 'Aquaman'
console.log(justiceLeague[2]); // undefined
console.log(justiceLeague[3]); // 'Batman'
console.log(justiceLeague.length); // 4
⬆ Back to Top

What are the different ways to create sparse arrays?
There are 4 different ways to create sparse arrays in JavaScript

Array literal: Omit a value when using the array literal
const justiceLeague = ['Superman', 'Aquaman', ,'Batman'];
console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', empty ,'Batman']
Array() constructor: Invoking Array(length) or new Array(length)
const array = Array(3);
console.log(array); // [empty, empty ,empty]
Delete operator: Using delete array[index] operator on the array
const justiceLeague = ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman'];
delete justiceLeague[1];
console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', empty, ,'Batman']
Increase length property: Increasing length property of an array
const justiceLeague = ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman'];
justiceLeague.length = 5;
console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman', empty, empty]

What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?
Set Timeout: setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
Set Immediate: The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
Process NextTick: If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.
